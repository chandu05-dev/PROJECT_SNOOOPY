PROJECT SNOOOPY
1. Project Snooopy is is a "personalized music library" build on Django and react.
2. It helps in building your own music library.
3. The backend code is in the master branch and the front end is in the main branch just for organizing purposes.
4. Thanks to the help of sqlite db which comes along with django set up, we dont need any external database to store all the data.
5. In order to run the backend of the application on your device, you need to first pull the code, create a new virtual environment and then import django, djangorestframework and django-cors-headers using pip and then run the application.
6. In order to run the frontend of the application on your device, you need to pull the code and do the necessary steps to create a react project and import axios@1.5.1, react-router-dom@6.16.0, react-router@6.16.0 using npm and then run the application.
7. Here I am attaching a youtube video uploaded on my channel to help you understand the code base and the working of the whole project along with a demo. I have added the video with the timestamp from where I show the working of the whole application. in order to understand the code base & implementation you can refer other parts of the video.
